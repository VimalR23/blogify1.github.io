        The similarity to the 2018/19 Champions League-winning campaign is that domestically Liverpool are chasing a rampant Manchester City, and it seems that having such an objective always brings the best out of Jürgen Klopp's team. When they hit top form, and everything works in devastating harmony, it's hard to see anyone coping with them.

Liverpool have faced stiff competition, which makes it even more iWho is Real Madrid coach?
Carlo Ancelotti. The manager who steered Madrid to 'La Décima' in 2014 returned last summer for a second stint in charge. He is one of just three coaches to have won the European Cup/Champions League on three occasions, and will be the first to manage in five finals.

Did you know?
Madrid have reached the European Cup final for the 17th time this season, six more than any other club. They have won their last seven finals in this competition and, of course, their total of 13 titles is unsurpassed.mpressive that they sport a near-perfect record: 12 games and just one loss in the round of 16 second leg against Inter. In fact, it was only the Nerazzurri who consistently troubled Klopp's side, at least until a nerve-strewn first-half display in the second leg of their semi-final against Villarreal. The way the Reds bounced back was a statement in itself, however.
<br>
How do Liverpool play?
Klopp rarely deviates from his tried and tested 4-3-3 formation – a system that has served the Reds wonderfully well since the German's arrival in 2015. Their high-intensity pressing has been refined in recent seasons – with a little help from smart acquisitions such as Diogo Jota and Luis Díaz – but it remains just as effective. At their best, they are arguably Europe's finest side.
Who is Liverpool's key player?
Mohamed Salah. The Egypt forward has been the face of this Liverpool side since arriving from Roma in 2017. A star at Basel, he first landed in England with Chelsea in 2014 but has proved a major talent on Merseyside, his pace, intelligence and finishing helping him bag 33 Champions League goals for the club.
<br>
Who is Liverpool Coach?
Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool boss since 2015, Klopp guided the Reds to continental glory in 2018/19 and to their first English title in 30 years the next season. A striker turned defender at Mainz, he masterminded two Bundesliga titles with Dortmund before heading to Anfield.
<br>
Did you know?
Liverpool have been European champions six times – more than any other English team. That is as many titles as Bayern, with Milan and Real Madrid the only clubs to have won more.

<p>If they can turn that epic tie against Manchester City around, having also stunned Paris and survived an onslaught from holders Chelsea, nothing is beyond them. Karim Benzema is in the form of his life, and with Vinicíus Júnior providing scintillating support, as well as the venerable Toni Kroos and Luka Modrić pulling the strings, who would dare rule out the 13-time winners doing what they do best?

    <br>
    How do Real Madrid play?
Working within a 4-3-3 template, Madrid have a strong spine starting with Thibaut Courtois and running through centre-back Éder Militão to the experienced midfield trio of Casemiro, Modrić and Kroos with all that technical quality, vision and experience. And then you get to the in-form Benzema up front – a master of the arts of centre-forward play. They also have the energy of increasingly influential younger players like Vinícius Júnior and Federico Valverde, as well as that intangible knowhow that gets them out of the tightest of spots.
<br>
Who is Real Madrid's key player?
Karim Benzema. Many people wondered where Real Madrid's goals would come from when Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2018, but the France forward has more than stepped up to the plate to become the club's talisman. He scored Madrid's 1,000th European Cup goal against Shakhtar earlier this campaign then turned around their last-16 tie with Paris with a second-half hat-trick before striking the decisive blow in extra time against the Blues to make it four goals in the tie. His Panenka against City almost defied belief and he was nerveless from the spot in the return too to send his side to the showpiece.
Who is Real Madrid coach?
Carlo Ancelotti. The manager who steered Madrid to 'La Décima' in 2014 returned last summer for a second stint in charge. He is one of just three coaches to have won the European Cup/Champions League on three occasions, and will be the first to manage in five finals.
<br>
Did you know?
Madrid have reached the European Cup final for the 17th time this season, six more than any other club. They have won their last seven finals in this competition and, of course, their total of 13 titles is unsurpassed.

    <h1 class="head">India announce 18-member squad for South Africa T20Is, Umran Malik receives maiden call-up</h1>
    <h3>Big names like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Jasprit Bumrah have been rested.</h3>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/Indian-Cricket-Team-10.webp" alt="">
    <p>After an enthralling two months of IPL fever, the action now shifts to the international fixtures as India is set to play two consecutive series at the same time after the cash-rich tournament comes to end on May 29. The big names like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah are expected to be on the flight to England for the one Test remaining from the tour last year while KL Rahul has been named as the captain of the limited-overs leg at home against South Africa.
<br>
The impressive youngsters from the IPL circuit this year have all been provided call ups for the South Africa series and it will be a great opportunity for them to excel on the international stage, ahead of the much-awaited T20 World Cup 2022. The combination of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal, who were outstanding in the IPL 2022 this year, is back as well.
<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Umran Malik, Arshdeep Singh earn maiden call-ups</h3><br>
    <p>Pace sensation Umran Malik, who has been one of the finds of IPL 2022, made it to the international setup for the first time after after an impressive season for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Arshdeep Singh, who was excellent in the death overs for the Punjab Kings, has been provided with an opportunity and his left-arm angle could be an added luxury.
<br>
In the batting department, Dinesh Karthik, who was in supreme form for RCB, has returned to the Indian squad. Hardik’s bowling fitness will be one of the things to watch out for in the series. His excellent captaincy for Gujarat Titans has earned him the responsibility at the international stage and his all-rounder role will be crucial to the plans of India in the T20 World Cup 2022 squad.
